2.Question 2                                            


In the field of music streaming applications, Spotify is the best app available.
The reason for this choice is:
1. The application works seamlessly in harmony on all types of platforms - ios, android, windows, linux, etc.
2. You can crossplay from one device(or platform) to another by just the press of a button
3. It has a wide collection of songs and podcasts in multiple languages
4. The UI/UX is beautiful and it has made great use of cardviews, recycler views, layouts, etc
5. You can add friends and see what they are listening to
6. It is very fast and offers great reccomendations and playlists. 
7. It is compatible with all major voice assitants like alexa, siri, google assistant or cortana.
8. At the end of the year they us our listening stats - fav artist, fav songs, hours spent listening, etc.

Its main competitors are apple music, Amazon music, TIDAL, youtube music, wynk, gaana, saavn, etc.
Spotify has one or more advantages over them all.

Apple music is not free.It does not have a web app. Moreover it is perfectly integrated into Appleâ€™s iOS ecosystem but not so much with other operating systems.
Amazon music does not have a good UI/UX, it doesnt have a lot of songs, its reccomendations and inbuilt playlists arent great. It has no content except music
TIDAL is not free either and is not used much in India and it doesnt have songs in many popular languages.
Youtube Music is not compatible with other voice assistants like alexa or siri. Its getting really good really fast but they still need to work on their content.
Wynk,gaana,saavn are majorly only used by indians hence a low userbase and low content too. There a lot of advertisments and the UI isnt the best. It doesnt have many features that spotify does.
